//if they choose to add an employee. get all info first to add. first name, ladt name and such using inquirer. with the exception of id, ask for everything explicitly like first, last name and role and manager id. use an insert into employees() but you won't know name and id until the name is gotten from inquirer. in syntax, it is exactly what the seeds file is doing.
